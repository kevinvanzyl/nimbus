This application uses **Auth0** for authentication and to get a Java Web Token for **Google+ People API** using OAuth 2.0 credentials. It uses a **Firebase** backend. It uses **AngularJS** and this is my first Angular project. \r\n# **Future direction**\r\n\r\n\r\nI will be working on this continuously and will be adding more social providers like Facebook and Twitter.\r\nI will also be rebuilding the UI with Ionic and adding customizations for users.\r\nI will be adding authentication for firebase and rules.\r\nLastly on my to do list will be some optimizations, cleanup and refactoring as I learn more about AngularJS. Changing the setup to bower oriented. I also want to integrate a testing framework.\r\n\r\nWhen it is at this point and ready for new features I will rather fork it into a new project and keep it as a minimal base for others to build onto.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
